          <div><p>Cassie Valentine is excited to see what her mother, Lori, and her new husband Richard Carlton, have brought back from their six-week honeymoon in the British Isles and Ireland. The couple’s souvenirs include special gifts from Richard to her and Michael Penfield that seem to acknowledge the paranormal abilities the two of them have. And while those presents were a welcome and unexpected surprise, Cassie is definitely not prepared for the other surprise that has come back with the newlywed couple. Shortly after their arrival, Cassie and Richard both begin to notice something different in the house: something that brings with it the scent of cigarette smoke and the sounds of heavy footsteps on the second floor. Not long afterward, Richard is the first to see an apparition of a young man in the bedroom. When he asks Cassie directly about her abilities, she knows something otherworldly is going on. Every haunting she and Michael have ever worked through was resolved with research on both their parts. But this haunting is firmly attached to Richard, and Cassie is nonplussed as to how to do research on him. In the end, she will have to confront Richard about the part he plays in his own haunting in order to help this uneasy spirit find peace.</p></div>
