&quot;Listen, do you believe in ghosts?&quot;<br>
&quot;Why?&quot;<br>
Jake smiled. That's better than a flat-out 'no'.&quot;<br>
&quot;I never said-&quot;<br>
&quot;You're the first person I ever met who could hear them.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hear who?&quot; I stopped and looked around. &quot;Where are we?&quot; I 
had long since lost track of where Mr. Burnham's grave was, and also the exit.<br>
&quot;I know where we are.&quot; Jake's expression was thoughtful. &quot;Corts, 
you've been hearing voices. Conversations. Who do you think is having them? We're 
the only ones here. The only living ones,&quot; he corrected with a grin.<br>
&quot;I don't know. Not ghosts.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
&quot;Just because. Ghosts? You're crazier than I am.&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't think so.&quot; There was a change in Jake's voice, a seriousness 
that brought goose bumps up on my arms.<br>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I demanded.<br>
&quot;I don't think you just hear ghosts, Corts. I think you're like me. I think 
you're haunted.&quot;
