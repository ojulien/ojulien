          <p>Ophelia Julien grew up in a haunted house on the near north side of Chicago and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Liberal Arts & Sciences from the University of Illinois – Chicago. The youngest in a family of avid readers, she can’t really remember not being able to read, but she remembers when she first started to write. Rhymes were her first love and she started playing with short poems when she was in third grade. By sixth grade she had set her sights on writing books when she discovered that the library didn’t have as many ghost stories on the shelves as she wanted. She was also naïve enough to think she could make her own stories end the way she wanted them to end!

<br><br>When she doesn’t have her nose, not to mention the entire rest of her head, in a book, she writes and seeks out the company of others who also like to write. She enjoys the spark and excitement of sharing ideas, plots, quotes, and anything else having to do with the process of writing, with like-minded people. Ghosts, phantoms, the paranormal, and the unexplained have been a life-long interest, and she continues to pursue that interest through both reading and writing.

<br><br>She has written for both Examiner Publications and The Daily Herald in the suburbs of Chicago, and has had several free-lance articles published in local DuPage County periodicals. A novel for young adults, Saving Jake, was published in 2002. Ghosts of Lake Michigan, a nonfiction effort, debuted in 2008. She also released a short story, Hunting Spirits, through Echelon Press. Her newest project, The Bridgeton Park Cemetery Series, was launched in 2012 with the release of the first book, Haunted. Dead Voices and Drawing Vengeance followed, and the series is ongoing. Another short story, She Loves You, was included in the dark fiction anthology Lyrical Darkness.

<br><br>She is a member of the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators, and listed with the Society’s Speaker’s Bureau. She has an author page on FaceBook, and can be reached through that, or through this website. She welcomes contact with her readers and loves to swap ghost stories.
