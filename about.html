          <p>Ophelia Julien grew up in a haunted house on the near north side of Chicago and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Liberal Arts & Sciences from the University of Illinois – Chicago. The youngest in a family of avid readers, she can’t really remember not being able to read, but she remembers when she first started to write. Rhymes were her first love and she started playing with short poems when she was in third grade. By sixth grade she had set her sights on writing books when she discovered that the library didn’t have as many ghost stories on the shelves as she wanted.<br><br>
Ghosts, phantoms, the paranormal, and the unexplained have been a life-long interest, and she continues to pursue that interest through both reading and writing.<br><br>
She has written for both Examiner Publications and The Daily Herald in the suburbs of Chicago, and has had several free-lance articles published in local DuPage County periodicals. A novel for young adults, Saving Jake, was published in 2002, followed in 2016 with its sequel, Missing Persons. Ghosts of Lake Michigan, a nonfiction effort, debuted in 2008. She also released a short story, Hunting Spirits, through Echelon Press. The Bridgeton Park Cemetery Series was launched in 2012 with the release of the first book, Haunted, and the series continues today with several more novels, and the e-book novella, A Trace of Ghosts. The short story She Loves You, was included in the dark fiction anthology Lyrical Darkness, and since then, she has collaborated with best-selling author Terri Reid on Ghosts, Graves, and Groves, a collection of true ghosts stories, and also with Terri Reid and Donnie Light on Softly Creeping, a short anthology of paranormal stories based on documented events and sightings. She was also invited to participate in Terri Reid’s KindleWorld Mary O’Reilly project and released the novella A Scattering of Bones.<br><br>
She is currently a member of The Author’s Guild and The Chicago Writers Association. She has an author page on Facebook, and can be reached through that, or through this website. She welcomes contact with her readers and loves to swap ghost stories with anyone who shares the same fascination.
