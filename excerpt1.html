Annie heard the chair beside the door creak and looked across the room, suddenly 
frightened. Of course she was alone. But the fringe on the afghan, tossed carelessly 
over the back of the chair, was swinging. <br>
I'ts just the draft from the air conditioning, nothing more, she told herself.<br>
But the vent was on ths same wall as the window, and the forced air blew in a 
different direction than the door.<br>
As she watched, more of the fringe began to move, swinging violently at first, 
then slowing down, then starting up again. The motion looked as though someone 
sat sideways in the chair, pushing the strands of yarn with a finger.<br>
This is crazy.<br>
She wanted to call her mother, ascertain that she wasn't alone in the house. She 
knew it would be no solution. Her mother would stroll in, professional journal 
in hand, glasses on her nose, and ask what was wrong, and isn't she too hot under 
all those covers? And Annie would have nothing to tell her. Nothing her mother 
would understand.<br>
You are alone. Your mother won't hear you...<br>
She stared at the chair with dread and fascination. Who are you? she thought, 
and then stopped immediately. It wanted her to probe, wanted her to join with 
it.
