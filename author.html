            Ophelia Julien grew up in a haunted house on the near north side of 
            Chicago and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Liberal Arts &amp; 
            Sciences from the University of Illinois &#8211; Chicago. The youngest 
            in a family of avid readers, she can&#8217;t really remember not being 
            able to read, but she remembers when she first started to write. Rhymes 
            were her first love and she started playing with short poems when 
            she was in third grade. By sixth grade she had set her sights on writing 
            books when she discovered that the library didn&#8217;t have as many 
            ghost stories on the shelves as she wanted. She was also na&iuml;ve 
            enough to think she could make her own stories end the way she wanted 
            them to end! 
            <p>When she doesn&#8217;t have her nose, not to mention the entire 
              rest of her head, in a book, she writes and seeks out the company 
              of others who also like to write. She enjoys the spark and excitement 
              of sharing ideas, plots, quotes, and anything else having to do 
              with the process of writing, with like-minded people. She likes 
              young adult novels because they tend to move faster than most adult 
              fiction, and because the situations and problems that arise can 
              be completely outside the realm of &#8220;grown-up reality&#8221; 
              - and frequently the target audience prefers it that way. Ghosts, 
              phantoms, the paranormal, and the unexplained have been a life-long 
              interest, and she continues to pursue that interest through both 
              reading and writing.</p>
            <p>She has written for both Examiner Publications and The Daily Herald 
              in the suburbs of Chicago, and has had several free-lance articles 
              published in local DuPage County periodicals. A novel for young 
              adults, Saving Jake, was released in 2002. She is a member of the 
              Society of Children&#8217;s Book Writers and Illustrators. She is 
              part of the SCBWI Speaker&#8217;s Bureau and would be happy to do 
              a presentation targeted at children in the middle grades and up.<br>
